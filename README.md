# MovieRecommendations

Mobile Apps Development

The streaming service Webflix wants to offer its users a mobile recommendation app for its movie offering. You have
been assigned to help Webflix to develop an Android app that displays at least ten of your
most favourite movies in a list. The app should display the name of the movie, the release
date, your rating and the genre. More information such as a short description and an image
should be provided on a detail screen. Integration with other apps such as the browser for
showtimes, list sorting options and a list search functionality are desirable features of the app.

Features
- Mobile application developed for the Android platform
- A list that displays your Top-10 most favourite movies
- An effective user interface with a comprehensive design of the list items displaying the required characteristics in a meaningful way 
- Brief comments in the code that describe the key features of the app and how they have been implemented
